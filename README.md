The official code implementation for CRGANNC from our paper, Sub-clustering based recommendation system for stroke patient: Identification of a specific drug class  for a given patient.

## Model description

Step 1. GMM dynamic clustering
Step 2. AF dynamic subclustering
Step 3. Generate K neighbors with KNN
Step 4. Calculate the representative rate for each drug among the k
